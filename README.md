## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

I learned greatly about the CSS box model during this project, and I learned how to center elements and display the correct width for each element. I also learned how to import a custom font used in this project.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

```css
.container {
  width: 265px;
  margin: auto;
  margin-top: 100px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3schools Center Element](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me learn about centering elements. I'd recommend this for attempting to center the main content of the page.
